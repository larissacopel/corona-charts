<p>On this data portal, explore different aspects of COVID-19 /
Coronavirus time evolution. I put this together because I saw a lot of
different visualizations and data views over many different sites but
no nice way to explore them all within the same tool. I hope this will
be as helpful for you as it was for me!</p>
<p>On this page you can set the x, y, color, and time axes to be
different aspects of the underling data, and also customize what
regions to display. When you find a set of projections that you like,
<a class="copylink" href="#">copy a link to share</a> or <a class="saveimage" href="#"> save the image</a> to your computer! If
you find something interesting, I'd be <a href="https://twitter.com/mstk">happy to hear from
you!</a></p>
<p>For some examples of configurations that might be useful, check these
out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a class="dataview" href="/?x=cno&y=ccccw3no&z=ccral50cnanif&t=tnd&m=fftf35|21">Bhatia-Reich plots</a>,
made famous by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc" target="_blank">this MinutePhysics video</a>.
Exponential growth shows up as a nice visual &quot;highway&quot; that regions
travel along, and it becomes very visually explicit when they exit
exponential growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="dataview" href="/?x=ccral50cnanif&y=ccccw2nif&z=ccccw2cmnif&t=tnd&m=fftf42|21">Growth curve plots</a>,
prominently displaying the infamous curves on the news that we are
supposed to be flattening. A logistic fit is added to get
satisfying bell curve projections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="dataview" href="/?x=tnd&y=ccgcw3no&z=cno&t=tcral58930nd?m=ffff">Percent growth plots</a>:
periods of perfectly exponential growth will show up as horizontal
lines. Colors reflect absolute counts, to show more info at a
glance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="dataview" href="/?x=dcccw7cccw7cmnif&y=dcccw7cmnif&z=ccral50cnanif&t=tnd&m=ffff">&quot;Baserunner&quot; Plots</a>,
which I've found very helpful personally. In this view, regions
all must move through a circular track, from &quot;home base&quot; at the
bottom, counter-clockwise; when they get back &quot;home&quot;, they are out
clear. Set-backs will visually appear as backtracking or getting
lost. Inspired by Danny Dorling's <a href="https://twitter.com/emmawage/status/1255172980788785152">tornado plots</a></p>

be found &quot;in between&quot; exponential growth and exponential decay, when
growth is controlled but not yet eliminated. Can also occur if reporting
measures (like tests) has a fixed capacity per-day.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Daily Change</em>: Increase in count per day</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="helptip" id="exponential-growth-fit"><p><strong>Exponential Growth</strong>: Assumes that the change every day is proportional
to the total amount of the previous day. This is the hallmark pattern of
uncontrolled epidemic growth, because each infected person becomes
themselves a source of future infection.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Daily % Growth</em>: Percent growth per day</li>
<li><em>Doubling Time</em>: Time it takes for count to double</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="helptip" id="logistic-fit"><p><strong>Logistic Growth</strong>: Assumes that exponential growth in the beginning will
steadily transition into exponential decay as limiting factors overpower
growth factors. In order to fit properly, this transition must have
already begun. Otherwise, it is indistinguishable from perfect
exponential growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Final Total</em>: Maximum count after growth ends</li>
<li><em>Date of Peak</em>: Date when growth is highest</li>
<li><em>95% Date</em>: Date when 95% of maximum count is reached</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="helptip" id="exponential-decay-fit"><p><strong>Exponential Decay</strong>: Assumes that the decrease in growth rate is
proportional to the total growth of the previous day. This will happen if
suppressing factors uniformly overpower spreading factors.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Final Total</em>: Maximum count after growth ends</li>
<li><em>95% Date</em>: Date when 95% of maximum count is reached</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="helptip" id="base-tip"><p><strong>Base Projection</strong>: The underlying dataset to begin building your axis
data from. This data will be run through the transformations below
to generate the data you want to plot.</p>
</div><div class="helptip" id="transformations-tip"><p><strong>Transformations</strong>: With the basic building blocks below, you can
generate many different unique aspects to visualize. Select different ones
to see how they affect your data, and what options they can be configured
with. Chain as many as you want, but be aware that not all
transformations can necessarily logically follow some others. This portal
will take the base projection you selected, run it through this chain, and
plot it.</p>
</div><div class="helptip" id="scale-tip"><p><strong>Scale</strong>: How to &quot;spread out&quot; the values on the plot, relative to each
other value.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Linear</em>: &quot;Normal&quot; scale ‚Äî fixed distance on plot corresponds to
fixed change in value. Can be the most &quot;truthful&quot;; however,
details for small scales can be lost if larger values are present.</li>
<li><em>Logarithmic</em>: Fixed distance on plot corresponds to fixed
<em>proportional change</em> in value. This is the natural scale for
exponential growth and decay, because they look like straight lines.
Also useful for being able to see detail at all scales.</li>
<li><em>Symmetric Log</em>: Log scales normally cannot show negative values;
symmetric log plots negative and positive numbers on flipped log
scales to preserve details at all scales, and stitches them together
around 0.</li>
</ul>

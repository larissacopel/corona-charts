# Features

*   symlog?
*   linear scale should admit zero axis choice
*   proper tooltip, text wrapping
*   data for different regions
*   exponential/logistic fits and projections
*   textwrap labels

# Fixes

*   the onLeave handler seems to be called too late when leaving the area
*   toggle switch for log/linear
*   Better labeling system
*   fast-forward to end button
*   behavior when no data supported, on plot
*   apparent bug: restrict-before for dates
*   feedback for parse errors in form elements
*   graceful handling of 0 countries
*   changing scales should be fast

# Someday

*   select to get statistics (mean, median, min, max)
*   icons
*   Discrete data: consider dot plots or bar graphs
*   localization
*   scale per capita
*   zoom in
*   fourier transform?  but this requires something on both axes...or at least
    to do them separately.
*   some sort of loading icon when  things are loading. but this is tricky
    because synchronous.

# Meh

*   configure playback speed?
*   window should have final day as the label, not the center
*   toggle sidebar on and off

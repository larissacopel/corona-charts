        ### Welcome!

        On this data portal, explore different aspects of COVID-19 /
        Coronavirus time evolution. I put this together because I saw a lot of
        different visualizations and data views over many different sites but
        no nice way to explore them all within the same tool. I hope this will
        be as helpful for you as it was for me!

        On this page you can set the x, y, color, and time axes to be
        different aspects of the underling data, and also customize what
        regions to display.  When you find a set of projections that you like,
        <a class="copylink" href="#">copy a link to share</a> or <a
        class="saveimage" href="#"> save the image</a> to your computer! If
        you find something interesting, I'd be [happy to hear from
        you!][twitter]

        For some examples of configurations that might be useful, check these
        out:

        *   <a class="dataview" href="/?x=cno&y=ccccw3no&z=ccral50cnanif&t=tnd&m=fftf35|21">Bhatia-Reich plots</a>,
            made famous by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc" target="_blank">this MinutePhysics video</a>.
            Exponential growth shows up as a nice visual "highway" that regions
            travel along, and it becomes very visually explicit when they exit
            exponential growth.

        *   <a class="dataview" href="/?x=ccral50cnanif&y=ccccw2nif&z=ccccw2cmnif&t=tnd&m=fftf42|21">Growth curve plots</a>,
            prominently displaying the infamous curves on the news that we are
            supposed to be flattening.  A logistic fit is added to get
            satisfying bell curve projections.

        *   <a class="dataview" href="/?x=tnd&y=ccgcw3no&z=cno&t=tcral58930nd?m=ffff">Percent growth plots</a>:
            periods of perfectly exponential growth will show up as horizontal
            lines. Colors reflect absolute counts, to show more info at a
            glance.

        *   <a class="dataview" href="/?x=dcccw7cccw7cmnif&y=dcccw7cmnif&z=ccral50cnanif&t=tnd&m=ffff">"Baserunner" Plots</a>,
            which I've found very helpful personally.  In this view, regions
            all must move through a circular track, from "home base" at the
            bottom, counter-clockwise; when they get back "home", they are out
            clear. Set-backs will visually appear as backtracking or getting
            lost. Inspired by Danny Dorling's [tornado plots][]

        These are truly unprecedented times, but it in a lot of cases it has

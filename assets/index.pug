      p
        | On this data portal, explore different aspects of COVID-19 /
        | coronavirus time series and their evolution. I put this together
        | because I saw a lot of different visualizations and data views over
        | many different sites but no nice way to explore them all within the
        | same tool. I hope this will be as helpful for you as it was for me!

      p
        | On this page you can set the x, y, color, and time axes to be different
        | aspects of the underling data.  When you find a set of projections that
        | you like,
        a.copylink(title='Copy Permalink to Chart' href='#')  copy a link to share
        |  or
        a.saveimage(title='Save as Image' href='#')  save the image
        |  to your computer!

      p
        | For some examples of visualizations that might be useful, check these out:

      ul
        li
          a.dataview(href='/?x=cno&y=ccccw3no&z=ccral50cnano&t=tno') Bhatia-Reich plots
          | , made famous by
          a(href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc')  this MinutePhysics video
          | .  Exponential growth shows up as a nice visual "highway" that countries
          | travel along, and it becomes very visually explicit when they exit
          | exponential growth.
        li
          a.dataview(href='/?x=dcccw7cccw7cmni&y=dcccw7cmni&z=ccral100cnano&t=tno') Baserunner Plots
          | , which I've found very helpful personally.  In this view, nations
          | all must move through a circular track, "home base" at the bottom,
          | counter-clockwise, all the way back "home", when disease
          | progression is halted.  Set-backs will visually appear as
          | backtracking or getting lost, whereas effective control measures
          | appear as very fast motion.  It's somewhat inspired by the infamous
          a(href='https://twitter.com/emmawage/status/1255172980788785152')  tornado plot
          | .
        li
          a.dataview(href='/?x=ccral50cnano&y=cno&z=ccral50cnano&t=tno') Time-shifted plot
          | , an example of a basic transformation you can explore.  This
          | tweaks the X axis to display "days since 50 cases confirmed", so
          | that you can visually compare the relative progression based on
          | the "arrival" of COVID-19.
